## User Stories

- **404** - As a user I want to see a nice 404 page when I go to a page that doesnâ€™t exist so that I know it was my fault
- **500** - As a user I want to see a nice error page when the super team screws it up so that I know that is not my fault
- **homepage** - As a user I want to log in and sign up, if I am logged in, this will redirect to my profile
- **sign up** - As a user I want to sign up on the web page so that I can work on planning my trips (store and plan them)
- **login** - As a user I want to be able to log in on the web page so that I can get back to my account
- **logout** - As a user I want to be able to log out from the web page so that I can make sure no one will access my account
- **city list** - As a user I want to see the list of my cities (past and upcoming trips in those cities) and delete them.
- **edit user** - As a user I want to be able to edit my profile and password (bonus: profile picture)
- **city homepage** - I can select the city and dates of my trip and save it in my trip portfolio. I am then rerouted to the homepage of the trip.
- **homepage of the trip**: As a user once I save my trip and go on it, I arrive on the landing on the map centered on the city with a search bar on the right side. In the heading it says " trip to city X from X to X".
- **search and results** - As a user I want to be able to search for places in the city where I am going to travel. When the place is found it drops a marker with the info window open asking the user to save the place to the trip todos. The place is saved to the trip. Bonus: we have different markers for different types of activities.
- **calendar vision** - As a User my activities are saved in my calendar, I can change the order and compute the walking distance every day.
